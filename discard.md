How might we begin to refactor the way we think with machines in  manner that serves intellectual expression and comnunity that affords/rather disregard care for each other, continually form the medium itself ,but also more generally a culture of futures or futurity. If we want to save ourselves from a future of purposelessness - where our intellectual expression is reduced a means for sustaining a livliehood 


When discussing the nvidia paper we noted that the output was super-normative... precisely because - it is a difference that makes a difference when it comes aesthetic novelty. The _selection_ of a difference, of novelty as valued and valuable is where machine learning and machines genrally fall short. The machine learning algorithm works weel in gaming because we can stipulate the conditions for a win. As someone put it nicely yesterday in the arts and humanities we dont know how to win. Another way of thinking that through might be to suggest that its the invention of the game, the realisation of what it means to win that 


So while machine's are a powerful means for producing novelty they are hopeless at realising when a particular novelty is interesting. The most interesting thing in both cases was not that an algorithm could 'think better than us' but that it could produce novelty - aesthetic intrigue, new understanding of the game - that it could never 'select' for and we couldn't have imagined...we needed the autonomy of the machine to afford the realisation of a novel aestehtic or conceptual intrigue between body an world.



we must works with abstractions that serve our autonomic thinking-feeling - rather than with systems that exploit that thinking feeling in the service of thier feral continuity.

reading had become secondary to writing, purposelessness









We came upon this problem yesterday when Liam was discussing the three recent papers - we were speaking about the anxiety produced of the way machine learning seemed to be able to 'think better' than we can - to beat us at our own games. But at the same time we discussed the notion that the alien game play of the machine seemed to divulge something novel about the game itself - new ways of playing - new potential for aesthetic intrigue in the play of the machine itself.

## Frankenmonsters in Education.

So as my bio states I'm apparently here under the guise of Polygon Door...a private creative tech lab I set up with another precarious uninveristy worker to explore the possibilty of forging an academic life outside of and away from the rolling casual 'contracts'of our precarious university existence. Under that guise I've spent the last year or so playing/designing/programming and teaching with programmable drawing machines - robots that draw. We developed the robot, wrote and api, and designed a pedagogy for exploring creativity as a process of experimentation and observation. While the robot appeals - because _robot_ - the power of the device is that it routes around the notion that knowledge production - creative thinking, aesthetic invention - occurs in head. It has been a lot of fun watching students learn to learn the power of an algorithm to realise and extend novelty - and to explore creative thinking and, yes innovation, as based in action and observation. Students (a parents/teachers) think they students are learning 'robotics' but what they actually learn is to think creatively, to learn to learn, by acting and observing and acting again. At some point a local high school took an interest and we 'pivoted' to that opportunity because some advisor told us thats what tech start-ups do (another bas abstraction for another day). Teachers love our little machine because students learn with it but Principals love it cause it ticks the STEM and Digital Curriculum box. The kits sell themsleves but I'm not really interested in selling tech to schools.
We've discovered that in the schools they seem to sit on shelves in 'maker spaces' equipped with mostly unused 3D printers. They robots serve a weird kind of purpose - they service a feral abstraction which cares nothing for their potential value as mechanism of knowledge production. Part of the issue is that technology alone is a bad abstraction for solving problems in learning and teaching (LMS's anyone?) and our problems in learning and teaching are tied to a monsterous machinic hybrid of policy, architecture, infrastructure and affect that has its own feral or perhaps zombie continuity. Technology alone can't refactor the bad abstractions at the heart and continuity of our education system - what is required is a refactoring of the abstractions of what it means to learn - and this would require us to begin again - to experiment with new abstractions. How the hell is that possible in the face of such a monstorous and multifacted continuity - under the demands on teachers to audit students, schools to audit teachers, and so on, and so on. 

The same intervention is required in the realm of academic knowledge prodcution - I'm sure there are one or two academics that will empathise with my robots. The problem is not technical - it's zombie infrastructural, 

## It's the abstraction stupid.

 I also teach media art at UOW.
 One of the things I do there is that  I use aesthetics and code to teach _abstraction_. 

Good programming is all about abstraction. Thats is its core activity. It is not principally about technical skills. Find a good abstraction and a program will write itself - teach a programmer abstraction and they will learn to code themselves. When we teach programming in media arts at UOW or at Polygon Door we immerse students in a study of an aesthetic - Perhaps Manfred Mohr, or Bridget Riley. In doing so we shift the emphasis away from technical skills to the abstraction of an aesthetic. In pursuit of an aesthetic Student's realise and are immersed in its complexity - sometimes they realise that they need to refactor their program because the aesthetic wasn't about circles (for instance) after all - the aesthetic drives the programming the programming immerses the student in an aesthetic. If the program becomes hard to write - its probably a bad abstraction and its time to refactor  - to rewrite the program starting with a different set of assumptions...a different abstraction. This approach successfully shifts the emphasis away from technical skill acquisition and technology more generally. Learning programming as skills acquisition is a technqiue based on a bad abstraction- that programming is about learning a language, about syntax. It also means my students occasionally produce interesting art. Their art is interesting because for the most part it avoids looking like yet another creative coding processing sketch. Creative coding sketches in the wider tend to look kind of similar. Their aesthetic is driven by what Processing's abstractions like to do when they succesfully outsource their affect to humans - produce lots of processing sketches. Same goes for any technical architecture. 90% of sound art sounds like PD/Max. 90% of presentations are a list of points.. until some tech person goes- wait a minute there must be a technical solution to that and then 50% of those 90% and up swirling incohate, motion sickness inducing, presy presentations.

## Livelihood as Abstraction Part 1 - Clean Trails.

One of my Life's obsessions is endurance trail running. My sport was until recently a quaint backwater of amatuerism. No-one was making any money - people actually did it for the running. That has changed, more people entered the sport, a market grew, a social media presence grew and events were streamed, more people entered the sport, athletes got sponsored, events became profitable, events got prize money, athletes have started to eek out a livlihood. All of a sudden drugs are a problem where before the notion of taking drug to complete or compete in a trail run would have been absurd - counter to the reason for doing it. A feral abstraction has taken hold. For a set of elite runners, trail running is now only secondarily about running. Its about livlihood. It seems that running clean and independently is a bad abstraction for livlihood, for genrating a large social media presence. It needed refactoring - so now trail running is an industry - and it is no longer just about the running - this is good for the sport apparently - the professionalism that is... Drugs are always bad - the problem is always the dirty runner... not the bad abstraction that sees performance enhancement as the right abstraction for genrating livlihood. It suddenly dawned on us all.. we got it round the wrong way...running isn't meant to be the abstraction for industry and it turns out that industry is a really shitty abstraction for clean running- but the Brumby has bolted...the feral abstraction is loose.  

## Livliehood as abstraction Part 2 - Knowledge Production.

The workshops framing statement says that 'for years academics have submitted to the poltical economy of the publishig industries' for 'esteem, prestige, job security (?), an outlet for intellectual expression, a basis for research money and some sense of community. The first three of these, esteem, prestige, and job security? are great abstractions of human affect in the service of sustaining a publishing industry. Its the right abstraction for the publishing industry and has trumped the latter two abstractions (community and intellectual expression). The industry has abandoned those last two (intellectual expression and community) because it turns out that providing an outlet for intellectual expression and commmunity are not great abstractions of affect in the service of an industry. 

But wait.... I've got it all round the wrong way... we didn't want an industry... we wanted knowledge production. Commmunity and Intellectual expression weren't meant to be abstractions they were meant to be abstractions for industry -  the publishing industry was meant to be an abstraction for them.
