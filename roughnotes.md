I will  place the artificial as a techno-bureacratic artificiality, an automation of relations that (amongst other things) disavows care. That might include a lack of care for each other, for the medium itself, but also more generally a culture of (the) future(s).The promise of online publishing becomes the nightmare of mundane, bureaucratic, and largely automated systems of knowledge management that as much as possible abstract away any actual interaction between knowledge producers (mostly in the interests of quantifying and accounting for knowledge production). Its all about abstraction - and its time to refactor.

The framing statement for this workshop stated that 'the prospect of cognition outsourced to machines is a worry to many'. So I'll start with that - It doesn't worry me in the slightest. Maybe that reflects my status as a precarious knowledge worker and relentless hacker of things and ideas - perhaps I'm less indebted to the knowledge machine, because I couldn't be arsed serving it, dedicating my life to it, I'd rather be running trails or indeed as the framing statement also suggested 'kicking back at another glorious day at the beach'. In previous years it wouldn't have worried me because I'm an experimentalist and technologist...and that was my interest in fibreculture .. surely there was potential for a revolution in knowledge production here right? But I'm done with that...Tech is a bad place to begin - that would be the wrong abstraction built on other wrong abstractions..it tooks me too long to work that out.

So...That said.

The most frightening instances of 'artificial intelligence' or 'autonomous systems' for me are those of the bureaucracy and policy, feral abstractions that have become infrastructural in a weird sense of the term - rather than persisting by becoming invisible and universal in adoption they sustain themselves via their relentless demands for service and debt calling, and in doing suck the energy out of any potential for addressing or redressing the abstraction that provides the basis for their continuity. These are almost always frankenstein monsters - hybrids - where machinic affect is outsourced to humans.. a much bigger problem in my mind than cognition outsourced to machines/policy/technology thought in a bigger Stieglerian sense. 

I've recently seen these frankenmonsters in education - and it makes for a good diagram of the problem - having developed a robot - a programmable drawing machine (a take on the turtlebot using open source electronics - for schools in which kids are able to work with open technology at an aesthetic and exploratory level rather than within STEM's instrumentalist paradigms. It works powerfully - as kids realise aesthetic potential they are motivated to devulge and extend algorithms and solve mechanical, electrical and electronic problems. Teachers love it. Admin loves it cause it seems to fit the STEM drive - but teachers simple have neither the time to use it - it doesn't fit the curriculum, the shape of the classrooms, the teachers disciplinary training and reposnsibilties, as developers we are forced to alter its teaching program to meet curriculum prescribed outcomes and infrastructural demands like 40 minutes classes. Schools love to buy robots because it makes them feel like they bought into the future. But robots sit on shelves in 'maker spaces' equppied with mostly unused 3D printers. Part of the issue is that technology alone is a bad abstraction for solving problems in learning and teaching (LMS's anyone?) and our problems in learning and teaching are tied to a monsterous machinic hybrid of policy, architecture, infrastructure and affect that has its own feral continuity. Teachers know the system is not working so they buy tech to solve it. Technology (and its corporate producers) have successfully outsourced their affect to humans to enable the production of lots more technology. Technology alone can't refactor the bad abstractions at the heart and continuity of our education system. 

Programming is about abstraction. Thats is its core activity. Its principally about technical skills. Find a good abstraction and a program will write itself - teach a programmer abstraction and they will learn to code themselves. When we teach programming in media arts at UOW or at Polygon Door we immerse students in a study of an aesthetic - Perhaps Manfred Mohr, or Bridget Riley. In doing so we shift the emphasis away from technical skills to the abstraction of an aesthetic. In pursuit of an aesthetic they realise and are immersed in its complexity - sometimes they realise that they need to refactor their program because the aesthetic wasn't about circles (for instance) after all - the aesthetic drives the programming the programming immerses the student in an aesthetic. If the program becomes hard to write - its probably a bad abstraction and its time to refactor  - to rewrite the program starting with a different set of assumptions...a different abstraction. This approach successfully shifts the emphasis away from skill acquisition. Starting programming with skills acquisition is a technqiue based on a bad abstraction- that programming is about learning a language, about syntax. It also means my students occasionally produce interesting art. Their art is interesting because for the most part it avoids looking like yet another creative coding processing sketch. Creative coding sketches in the wider world all look kind of similar because their aesthetic is driven by what Processing's abstractions like to do when they succesfully outsource their affect to humans - produce lots of processing sketches. Same goes for any technical architecture. 90% of sound art sounds like PD/Max. 90% of presentations are a list of points.. until some tech guy goes- wait a minute there must be a technical solution to that and then 50% of those 90% and up swirling incohate motion sickness inducing presy presentations.

One of my lifes obsessions is endurance trail running. My sport was until recently a quaint backwater of amatuerism. Noone was making any money - people actually did it for the running. That has changed, more people entered the sport, a market grew, a social media presence grew, more people entered the sport, athletes got sponsored, events became profitable, events got prize money, athletes have started to eek out a livlihood. All of a sudden drugs are a problem where before the notion of taking drug to complete or compete in a trail run would have been absurd - counter to the reason for doing it. A feral abstraction has taken hold. For the elite trail running is now only secondarily about running. Its about livlihood. It seems that running clean and independently is a bad abstraction for livlihood, for genrating a large social media presence. It needed refactoring - so now trail running is an industry - and its no longer just about the running - which is good for the sport.. apparently. It suusdnely dawned on us all.. we got it round the wrong way...running isn't meant to be the abstraction for industry and it turns out that industry is a really shitty abstraction for clean running- but the Brumby has bolted...the feral abstraction is loose.  

The workshops framing statement says that 'for years academics have submitted to the poltical economy of the publishig industries' for 'esteem, prestige, job security (?), an outlet for intellectual expression (? what a novel idea), a basis for research money and some sense of community. The first three of these are great abstractions of human affect in the service of sustaining a publishing industry. The publishing industry has succesfully outsourced its affect in the service of sustaining itself. Its the right abstraction for the publishing industry and has trumped the latter two abstractions (community and intellectual expression). The industry has abandoned those two because it turns out that like running, providing an outlet for intellectual expression and commmunity are not great abstractions of affect in the service of an industry. But wait.... I've got it all round the wrong way... we didn't want an industry... we wanted knowledge production. Commmunity and Intellectual expression weren't meant to be abstractions they were meant to be abstractions for industry -  the publishing industry was meant to be an abstraction for them. 

When I started with FCJ I was motivated by the thought that my tech skills and my theoretical bent might find an outlet there. 
The mailing list with which Fibreculture had begun and which had initally been a means of coalescing and organising for a dispersed community of antidisicplinary outsider academics in a nascent field was inspiring but was nearing the end of its 'life' - the abstractions that make mailing lists such great vehicles for community and intellectual expression also make those communities and expressions burn bright and with many notable exceptions... short (where they are long lived its because the still support one or both - think nettime or empyre). The good thing about that is that online communities (which are too fragile to be coopted), intellectual expression, and mailing lists apparently don't make great abstractions for anything else (esteem, prestige for example) and so mailing lists thankfully die a natural timely death once they cease to serve as the basis for community or intellectual expression. This is a great and misunderstood thing. We should let things die. If we dont let our abstractions live and die on their own terms we infect them with franken-affects and create zombie continuities. This should provide a note for the workshop statement's 'horizon of doom', 'futurity without purpose' for 'the knowledge genrated out of the academy' and fear of the journal article's absolesence -  my advice is to embrace the horizon of doom, embrace purposelessness, celebrate the journal article's obsolescense - hit the beach if thats where you want to be (I'll see you there or run past you), but if your desire is for academic community and intellectual expression then its time to refactor. In  programming the demand to refactor feels kind of positive...you've learnt something fundamental so starting again is actually never starting from the beginning... for me its a eureka moment of sorts - or at least ... 'oh ... now I get it'.

So.. Journals. I took over the journal as the previous manager faced having to refactor - from manually marking up html to the adoption of a content management system.  I think - the lack of seperation of form from content is not as bad as it its web2.0 detractors might have had it. It meant that you didn't embed an assumption of what seperated form from content in your particular expression. Fibreculture (with a number of others at the time) was in part born with this kind of question in mind (Some embraced flash to this end...rendered, proprietary, not open... bad abstraction and those experiemnts are mostly gone or going - Lisa and Andrew made a wise decision here). The problem with not seperating form from content is that you have to deal with both and their interaction (the appropriate abstraction) _all the time_ which is terrific if you have many people for that.

I had experience with Drupal, Wordpress and OJS was just released. All were candidates. I went with WP because its seperation of form from content was based on a good simple abstraction - the power of that abstraction (site as journal as a series of posts)is the secret to wordpress continued dominance (in my opinion)- another aside - good (vital) abstractions are nearly always simple (or the simplest possible for the application - this is drupal's problem). This seperation of form form content meant we would need to go through the torture of extracting form from content when the next best system came along. It would allow us to refactor at any point - meaning we aren't (as) subject to the franken-affect platform bias - and we could actively experiment with novel abstractions of fibrecultural content. We can still abstract the whole journal as a json file - in fact you could do it today...because its licensced 'cc-by' anyone can ... (another note to the fear of data expropriation expressed in the framing statement - i don't think you can have your commons and dictate its terms..). 

This was a good start. I still think wordpress was a good abtraction for an academic journal. It needed some tweaking and perhaps an adherence to the form of a traditional journal meant I built complexity into the form that made it more difficult for others to work on the mundane technical stuff that needed to be done. The real mistake was that the academic journal was a shitty abstraction for a system of networked knowledge production, for intellectual expression, and community. This is the crux of this diatribe about feral abstraction. 

For the past 3 years or so FCJ has felt like a beast that required serving and part of a machine that required endless servicing. I have feared impending issues reaching editorial completion just as I knew my fellow managing editors had feared the issues' delivery - and quite rightly - the work was enormous and increasing as the demands to publish meant writing had become secondary to publishing, publishing had become secondary to instituional and professional audit, moreover community had been suffocated out, reading had been abstracted out completely (because you can't measure it) so finding reviewers who would deliver was tough. We increasingly felt like the journal had become 'a publishing service' for time poor academics. Moreover sometimes it felt that as independent community publication we were for many a second or third option - this seemed more true following the arbitrary journal rankings circus took hold - a better example of the inanity of audit culture I am yet to see (dumber than naplan). Of course many who succesfully published with us did so in dedication to the project itself- for these people the journal remained or was worth fighting for as an outlet of intellectual expression and/or community. The editorial and managerial weight of producing the journal however meant that it struggled to serve these people well in the face of other demands. Moreover we were working completely voluntarily and indpendently without institutional support. Which is fine if the journal is serving your (meaning my) needs as well - for me this meant the potential for playing with new forms of knowledge production and intellectual expression _as_ intellectual expression and the basis for community. Of course it provided other things ... minor esteem and the privelidge of remaining engaged with academia depsite and in service of my precarious employment - but thats never been a very good abstraction of my affect, nor is it a good abstraction in service of intellectual expression or community.

One of the other things that happened was that increasingly the development of infrastructures around open access publishing shifted from experimenting with novel forms and potentialities of openness - of an intellectual commons - to once of competing with (the corporate publishing industry and with other publications) and for the network effect in pursuing citations (a weird abstraction of reading). Time potentially spent between issues working on novel abstractions of knowledge production afforded by my lovely open source and content management system wa spent trying to build plugins to meet the demnds of the next best greatest metadata standard, or the metadata standards of open access repositories, or of corporate or institutional indexers. If I denied that development citations would be sacrificed, the standing of the journal would slip, and so on and so on. While fundamentally opposed to audit culture we seemd completely indebted to its demands as an 'academic journal'. We were using the network - this agile, indeterminate, open beast to 'occupy' a shitty feral industrial abstraction which had already abstracted away intellectual expression and community (many society journals had long ago given over their intellectual capital to publishing houses) as the means to refactor and explore new abstractions for community and intellectual expression (as the fibreculture mailing list serendipitously did). In occupying that feral abstraction we've been pushing shit up hill trying to reaasert the journal as a useful abstraction for intellectual expression and community.

This leads to platform bias. Increasingly it seemed the Open Journal System (OJS) made all of that stuff really easy. The demand to move to it was and is still great. Having transitioned one other journal to it - I'd rather stab myself in the eye than do that - needless to say affect plays a part here. OJS embeds logics and hierarchies of traditional academic journal production deep in its terribly convoluted code base - while OJS is open source, its source is completely lacking in agility or openness. While wordpress begins with a simple basic abstraction (posts and pages) and everthing else builds from there OJS attempts to abstract all of the publishing industries' and logics' - meaning there is realistically and without much hacking around only one form of journal that can be produced with it, one form of journal article - it would free FCJ from the demands of meeting those aformentioned metdata requirements, it would be good for citations. We would be thoroughly entrained in the with the 'political economies of the publishing industry' -  we'd have completely *occupied* the academic journal...it'll be great *for* the journal, for its standing, its esteem. It will ensure we have a 'futurity with purpose'....right?

The problem is the the 'academic journal' was an abstraction employed as the basis for maintianing an outlet for intellectual expression and community right? Not for counting citations, or for institutional and corporate indexing, not for the open extraction of its counting of its citation data - but rather the open development of its knowledge and community. In my experience the former is not a function of the latter. In part this is actually not a war on OJS in preference of WP (although I'm i'm good for a fight) - its an argument that technology is not the root of the problem - the abstraction is and replacing one tech for another won't lead to a refactoring of the underlying and feral abstraction. Neither will 'occupying' the abstraction via technology. That was my mistake with wordpress... FCJ should have been an academic blog, not a journal. That would have been one way to test a novel abstraction...I kind of killed that potential by trying to make wordpress an academic Journal - an abstraction that was already broken/zombified and certainly unfit fibrecultural occupation. In the end it feels a little like the Journal abstraction occupied FCJ as an experiment in online open access publishing...in the same way that the publishing industry occupied Openess as Open Access. That is to say it would have been better or worse... but at the very least it would have been a new abstraction. 

We can't actually  know how any abstraction will play out - we have to play it, abstractions demand material research - but we can 'audit' that abstraction in experimentation and play (indeed we have a responsibility to do so) - check that its doing what we signed it up for and if its time to refactor. This has a practica


I've done a personal audit of the journal abstraction - admittedly its qualitative and subjective -  and qualified by the fact that I'm not interested in serving either your or my academic career (I dont have one) - but I've decided the journals is a bad abstraction for the things I wanted it for, those two trade-offs I deemed worthy of our submission to the abstractions of the 'political economy of the publishing industries' - as an 'outlet for intellectual expression' and 'a sense of community'. We'd already decided that the 'poltical economy of the publishing industries' has abstracted away these things and we attempted to occupy the journal as a result. But occupying ended up in an inversion of its intent (we should have seen this coming - occupations rarely serve revolutions). 

Where might that refactoring begin? It seems to me that refactoring might go back to consider why we write. Once of the dissapointing aspects of the Journal abstraction is the reality that a journal actually does seem to be the place academic thinking goes to die- Or at least it goes into deep hibernation waiting for a someone searching an index somehwere to temporarily revive in a moment of barely qualified extraction in the form of a citation. What a shitty abstraction for reading most cites are (as discussed in Wall-Smith 2001, Murhpie 2002, Fuller 2008 - note - these is not a rela citation). What a shitty anstraction of impact they are - the equivalent of a hat-tip in the hope of recieving one in return - serving a community of instrumental hat-tippers. As far as I can see we are writing more and more, and reading less and less. How might we refactor writing in the service of encouraging reading and how might we allow reading to fold forward in continuity with writing so that the netwprk becomes a space of agile multilogue - but wait - it already is that - the technology is there and is not the answer anyway , the answer in supporting an ecology of experimentation in open 'minor' abstractions. Part of my reasoning for loving wordpress is that its abstraction refuses to embed logics



To conclude I want to suggest that all of this comes down to a demand to refactor those 





reading had become secondary to writing, purposelessness
