The most frightening instances of 'artificial intelligence' or 'autonomous systems' are those of the bureaucracy and policy, feral abstractions -     I will  place the artificial as a techno-bureacratic artificiality, an automation of relations that (amongst other things) disavows care. That might include a lack of care for each other, for the medium itself, but also more generally a culture of (the) future(s).The promise of online publishing becomes the nightmare of mundane, bureaucratic, and largely automated systems of knowledge management that as much as possible abstract away any actual interaction between knowledge producers (mostly in the interests of quantifying and accounting for knowledge production). To put it bluntly, there is not much collegiality left in the ecology of publishing (as a precarious knowledge worker, I am not sure if it is still there in the university). What is the role of technology in the production of these feral abstractions? 

At its heart programming is about abstraction. Find the 'good' abstraction and the program tends to write itself - which I suppose is an extension of finding a good metaphor when writing. A 'good' abstraction is however in very rare occasions the 'right' abstraction - Where the right abstraction is one that demonstrates and elucidates the intention with which the programmer proposed it.  A weed has arguably evolved as great abstraction of wide ranging environmental conditions. A weed is rarely the 'right' abstraction for the environment onto which it grafts. A (good) programmer is continuously 'refactoring' - a term which I think is unique to programming and which refers to the realisation that at some point the abstraction upon which your program is built is fundamentally limiting or distracting and that the only way forward is to rewrite the program from scratch. Refactoring is never a failure - it is a realisation made via an immersion in the mechanics of the abstraction and its interaction with the language upon which it builds. Of course you need to be immersed in these mechanics in order to realise the need to refactor or how to go about it - otherwise you are left to critique as subject-to the abstraction (and critique is subject of it own its mediums abstractions as well). 

Having finally exhausted any remnant of techno-optimism I am reluctant to propose that what we need are new abstractions, to refactor academic knowledge production - to move well away from the demands to account, quantify and measure based on the exisiting ones and to refactor modes of 'academic' writing and communicating (of course 'academic' might well be the wrong abstraction).
