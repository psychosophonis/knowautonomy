- Who are you? Why are you here? Fibreculture, UOW, Polygon Door.

- I enjoy hacking ideas, machines, code in order to explore what they might do. 

To that end I'm interested in exploring novel 'abstractions'in knowledge production much more than I am in __academic publishing__ -per se. I want to talk about how for ten years i worked voluntarily in academic publishing in spite of that.

- In fact my interest in the fibreculture was intially as a place/group/platform that would support such rethinkings and experimentation ....and it was so I also want to talk about how we _all_ spent the last ten years servicing and contributing to an academic journal in spite of that.

To put it aanother way..
  
I wonder if while Fibreculture's intent in exploring online publishing, open access and open source  -an attempt to 'occupy the academic journal'- actually ended up _occupying_ fibreculture more generally - and in that case whether or not the journal and the journal article were poor abstractions for intellectual expression and academic community. 

In extension of that perhaps I want to ask whether the notion of 'occupying' anything is just a really terrible poltical abstraction. We shouldn't have occupied the journal...we should have refactored.. experimented with novel abstractions. Maybe there is something interesting to note here regarding what I think Ned refered to yesterday as an _autonomy of politics_ as opposed to a _political autonomy_....  

- I've should also acknowledge that there was another project in whihc I spent considerable amount of time thinking through and writing about cognition, cognitive ecologies, the relationship between mind and media, and the position of technology with regard to our ecology of thinking/feeling. - Without restating the whole thing I was fascinated on the one hand by Brian Massumi's positioning of affect as central to cognition - perception as cognition largely _autonomic_ as opposed to _autonomous_  and on the other hand Stielger's Technics and Time which begins with _'technics apprehended as the horizon of all possibilty to come and all possibilty of a future.'_ 

- Much of this came out of a concern for how we might best build what Stiegler called 'technologies of mind' and which I like to think as a 'spirited technics'. To put it as simply straightforwardly as possible - I'm interested in how we are always thinking with and through technics/machines - and so the interesting question (for me) is  not so much a concern for outscourcing of our cognition to machines - but how are we are always doing so, have always done so - and how might we do it better or differently. 

I think there is a beguiling play between words autonomy and autonomic here.. and so I wonder if an autonomy of poltics might depend on careful attention to the autonomic continuities that begin with an intial abstraction and the way that abstraction modulates our interaction with a particular machine/algorithm.

I'm positing abstraction as a kind of proto technics - forming a horizon of technical possibility...
 
- and a a proviso.... after yesterday I madly rewrote my already rewritten dot points become paper - become book chapter- become monograph - and had to search FCJ for a reference .... and I kind of suddenly realised how cool it is - and that I should stop being a critical bastard and just let it be... and thank everybody who contributed because its a terrific archive of interesting work. Its more than enough. But what now. Ned posited some interesting hacks...but I wonder whether rather than gaming the system we might think experimenting with novel abtsractions for intellectual expression and academic community.

----------------

So in dialogue with the workshop's framing statement while I'm not so concerened with the outsourcing of cognition - we have always outsourced cognition - I am more worried about the way machines outsource their affect. The kind of artificial that concerns me is a techno-bureacratic artificiality-  an automation of relations that (amongst other things) disavows care. That might include a lack of care for each other, for the medium itself, for intellectual expression ,but also more generally a culture of futures or futurity.

The most woriesome of 'artificial intelligence' or 'autonomous systems' are perhaps those of the bureaucracy and policy in which feral abstractions have become oddly infrastructural - oddly because they remain visible, we'd like to replace them or update them, but they sustain themselves via their relentless demands for service and debt calling, and in doing suck the energy out of any potential for addressing or redressing the abstraction that provides the basis for their continuity. 

When I started with FCJ I was motivated by the thought that my strange blend of interests in tech and theory  might find an outlet there. The mailing list with which Fibreculture had begun and which had initally been a means of coalescing and organising for a dispersed community of antidisicplinary outsider academics in a nascent field was inspiring but was nearing the end of its 'life' - 

Mailing lists were/are actually great vehicles for community and intellectual expression. The good thing about that is that online communities (which are too fragile to be coopted), intellectual expression, and mailing lists apparently don't make great abstractions for anything else (esteem, prestige for example) and so mailing lists thankfully die a natural timely death once they cease to serve as the basis for community or intellectual expression. 

This is a great and misunderstood thing. We should let things die. If we dont let our abstractions live and die on their own terms we infect them with franken-affects and create zombie continuities. This should provide a note for the workshop statement's 'horizon of doom', 'futurity without purpose' for 'the knowledge genrated out of the academy' and fear of the journal article's absolesence -  my advice is to embrace the horizon of doom, embrace purposelessness, celebrate the journal article's obsolescense - hit the beach if thats where you want to be (I'll see you there or run past you), but if your desire is for academic community and intellectual expression then its time to refactor. The demand to refactor comes from programming. Its usually the case when writing a program that at some point writng the code becomes laborious - a point at whihc you start fighting against  the abstraction from which you began and upon which all subsequent code is based. The desire is to keep pushing the abstraction - beniding it to your will - but eventually you come to a point when you understand there was a better way - a better abstraction from which to begin - and to move forward you must refactor - start again with a different abstraction. Note that the problem is rarely the code itself - its the idea that strctures the code- thats shapes your subsequent interaction, or possible interactions with it.

So.. Journals.

The workshops framing statement says that 'for years academics have submitted to the poltical economy of the publishig industries' for 'esteem, prestige, job security (?), an outlet for intellectual expression, a basis for research money and some sense of community. The first three of these, esteem, prestige, and job security? are great abstractions of human affect in the service of sustaining a publishing industry. Its the right abstraction for the publishing industry its works well to sustain it...but its a great example of the kind of artificial that concerns me - that techno-bureacratic artificiality-  an automation of relations that (amongst other things) disavows care as I said that might include a lack of care for each other, for the medium itself, for intellectual expression, but also more generally a culture of futures or futurity. In the poltical economy of the publishing industry saw the the latter two abstractions (community and intellectual expression) dumped because it turns out that providing an outlet for intellectual expression and commmunity are not great abstractions of affect in the service of an industry and institution. 

But we didn't want to work in the sustain of an industry did we - to eek out a 'relevance' within it - as it was positied yeaterday... we wanted knowledge production. Commmunity and Intellectual and expression/writing - and the bodies that produce it -weren't meant to be abstractions in the sustain of industry -  the publishing industry was meant to be an abstraction for them.  Its time we audited that abstraction...if writing is abstraction for inetllectual expression and community how might we refactor our practices of knowledge production in support of that. Perhaps then we can invert the concern for machines that 'think better than us' - how might we build abstractions that allow us to think better with machines, and build machine that allow us to think better - that is non-autonomously - acknowledging the propensity for our autonomic entrainment according to the potential of a given abstraction - the outsourcing of our affective drive in the service of the machine. How might we build machines/policies/architectures/infrastructures that employ affect in a manner that allows us to exploit what the way the machine allows us to do better to extend coginition beyond the habitual service of our present abstractions. 

So FCJ...

I took over the journal as the previous manager Lisa Gye couldn't face having to refactor - from manually marking up html to the adoption of a content management system. The great advance of  Web2.0 was apparently the realisation that we should seperate form from content - and indeed the possibilty of coding endless web pages by hand seemed to back that up. In hindsight I wonder if the values of that separation were overegged - something shifted at that point. When form and content were intertwined it meant you had to always consider both together and form could well follow content. You were encouraged back to look at the abstraction again - potentially refactor form specifically for a paper. That wasn't going to happen one content and fomr were seperate. Of course it was not sustainable to run a journal otherwise... but Fibreculture  was born with this kind of question in mind.. once the form was set The Journal became a container for writing form that point on. 

I chose WP as architectures and went  because its seperation of form from content was based on a good simple abstraction - the power of that abstraction (site as journal as a series of posts)is the secret to wordpress continued dominance on the net. A simplest abstraction is almost always the right abstraction. The more we encode assumptions as elaborate abstractions of process and form the less agile your abstraction is - and the more likely at some point you will be forced to refactor the entire thing. When this involves a manipulation and interwining of code and content (as html did - and which required a massive effort to extract the legacy content) the more likely your are to be caught within that abstraction - your only choice is to serve it becuase the work invovled in moving it would be vast or the content itself would need refiguring. WP's simple, agile, abstraction would allow us to refactor at any point - meaning we aren't (as) subject to the franken-affect platform bias - and we could actively experiment with novel abstractions of fibrecultural content. We can still abstract the whole journal as a json file - in fact you could do it today...because its licensced 'cc-by' anyone can ... (another note to the fear of data expropriation expressed in the framing statement - i don't think you can have your commons and dictate its terms..). 

This was a good start. I still think wordpress was a good abtraction for an academic journal. It needed some tweaking and perhaps an adherence to the form of a traditional journal meant I built complexity on top of WP's lovely simple abstraction that made it more difficult for others to work on the mundane technical stuff that needed to be done. The real mistake was that the academic journal was a shitty abstraction for a system of networked knowledge production, for intellectual expression, and community. This is the crux of this diatribe about feral abstraction. 

For the past 3 years or so FCJ has felt like a beast that required serving and part of a machine - the academic publishing system -  that required endless servicing. I have feared impending issues reaching editorial completion just as I knew my fellow managing editors had feared the issues' delivery - and quite rightly - the work was enormous and increasing as the demands to publish meant writing had become secondary to publishing, publishing had become secondary to instituional and professional audit, moreover community had been suffocated out so finding reviewers who would deliver was tough, and worse still analytics showed that reading had been abstracted out completely (because you can't measure it). More people wanted to publish than wanted to read what was published.

We increasingly felt like the journal had become 'a publishing service' for time poor academics. Moreover sometimes it felt that as independent community publication we were for many a second or third option - this seemed more true following the arbitrary journal rankings circus took hold - a better example of the inanity of audit culture I am yet to see (dumber than naplan). Of course many who succesfully published with us did so in dedication to the project itself- for these people the journal remained or was worth fighting for as an outlet of intellectual expression and/or community. The editorial and managerial weight of producing the journal however meant that it struggled to serve these people well in the face of other demands. 

Moreover we were working completely voluntarily and indpendently without institutional support. Which is fine if the journal is serving your (meaning my) needs as well - for me this meant the potential for playing with new forms of knowledge production and intellectual expression _as_ intellectual expression and the basis for community. Of course it provided other things ... minor esteem and the privelidge of remaining engaged with academia depsite and in service of my precarious employment - but thats never been a very good abstraction of my affect, nor is it a good abstraction in service of intellectual expression or community.

One of the other things that happened was that increasingly the development of infrastructures around open access publishing shifted from experimenting with novel forms and potentialities of openness - of an intellectual commons - to once of competing with (the corporate publishing industry and with other publications) and for the network effect in pursuing citations (a weird abstraction of reading). Time potentially spent between issues working on novel abstractions of knowledge production afforded by my lovely open source and content management system was spent building plugins to meet the demnds of the next best greatest metadata standard, or the metadata standards of open access repositories, or of corporate or institutional indexers. If I denied that development citations would be sacrificed, the standing of the journal would slip, and so on and so on. While fundamentally opposed to audit culture we seemd completely indebted to its demands as an 'academic journal'. We were using the network - this agile, indeterminate, open beast to 'occupy' a shitty feral industrial abstraction which had already abstracted away intellectual expression and community (many society journals had long ago given over their intellectual capital to publishing houses) as the means to refactor and explore new abstractions for community and intellectual expression (as the fibreculture mailing list serendipitously did). In occupying that feral abstraction we've been pushing shit up hill trying to reaasert the journal as a useful abstraction for intellectual expression and community.

This leads to platform bias. Increasingly it seemed the Open Journal System (OJS) made all of that network effect management stuff really easy. The demand to move to it was and is still great. Having transitioned one other journal to it - I'd rather stab myself in the eye. See OJS fourther embeds logics and hierarchies of traditional academic journal production deep in its terribly convoluted code base. While the WP abstraction begins with a user, a post, and maybe comments - OJS begins with articles, reviewers, editors, contributors, managing editors, administrators, readers, reviews, volumes etc etc... 

While OJS is open source, its source is completely lacking in agility or openness, its abraction is deeply embedded. This means that there is realistically and without much hacking around only one form of journal that can be produced with it, one form of journal article. Transitioning to OJS would would free FCJ from the demands of meeting those aformentioned metdata requirements, it would be good for citations. But... we would be thoroughly and further entrained with the 'political economies of the publishing industry' -  we'd have completely *occupied* the academic journal...it'll be great *for* the journal, for its standing, its esteem. It will ensure we have a 'futurity with purpose'....right?

The problem is the the 'academic journal' was an abstraction employed as the basis for maintianing an outlet for intellectual expression and community right? Not for counting citations, or for institutional and corporate indexing, not for the open extraction of its counting of its citation data - but rather the open development of its knowledge and community. In my experience the former is not a function of the latter. In part this is actually not about a particular code base)- its an argument that technology is not the root of the problem - the abstraction is - Wordpress or OJS we were stuck in the feral abstraction of the publishing industry in which writing had an 'abstraction' for livliehood. Replacing one tech for another won't lead to a refactoring of the underlying and feral abstraction. Neither will 'occupying' the abstraction via technology. That was my mistake with wordpress... perhaps FCJ should have been an academic blog, not a journal. That would have been one way to test a novel abstraction...I kind of killed that potential by trying to make wordpress an academic Journal - an abstraction that was already broken/zombified and certainly unfit fibrecultural occupation. In the end it feels a little like the Journal abstraction occupied FCJ as an experiment in online open access publishing...in the same way that the publishing industry occupied Openess as Open Access. That is not to say it would have been better or worse... but at the very least it would have been a new abstraction. 

We can't actually  know how any abstraction will play out - we have to play it, abstractions demand material research - but we can 'audit' that abstraction in experimentation and play (indeed we have a responsibility to do so) - check that its doing what we signed it up for and if its time to refactor. The journals is a bad abstraction for the things I wanted it for, those two trade-offs I deemed worthy of our submission to the abstractions of the 'political economy of the publishing industries' - as an 'outlet for intellectual expression' and 'a sense of community'. We'd already decided that the 'poltical economy of the publishing industries' has abstracted away these things and we attempted to occupy the journal as a result. _Occupying_ ended up in an inversion of its intent -we should have seen this coming - occupations rarely serve revolutions. 

So where might that refactoring begin? It seems to me that refactoring might go back to consider why we write - what is the _purpose_ of our intellectual expression, why do we need an _outlet_, why in writing do we need some sense of _community_ - what function does it serve?. Once of the dissapointing aspects of the Journal abstraction is the reality that a journal actually does seem to be the place academic thinking goes to die- Or at least it goes into deep hibernation waiting for a someone searching an index somehwere to temporarily revive in a moment of barely qualified extraction in the form of a citation. What a poor abstraction for reading most cites are (as discussed in Wall-Smith 2001, Murhpie 2002, Fuller 2008). What a poor abstraction of impact they are - the equivalent of a hat-tip in the hope of recieving one in return - serving a community of instrumental hat-tippers. As far as I can see (and I watch the analytics) we are writing more and more, and reading less and less. How might we refactor writing in the service of encouraging reading and how might we allow reading to fold forward in continuity with writing so that the network becomes a space of agile multilogue - but wait - it already is that - the technology is there and is not the answer anyway , the answer is perhaps in supporting an ecology of experimentation in open 'minor' abstractions perhaps this is a means to what Ned called a autonomy of politics.





reading had become secondary to writing, purposelessness









We came upon this problem yesterday when Liam was discussing the three recent papers - we were speaking about the anxiety produced of the way machine learning seemed to be able to 'think better' than we can - to beat us at our own games. But at the same time we discussed the notion that the alien game play of the machine seemed to divulge something novel about the game itself - new ways of playing - new potential for aesthetic intrigue in the play of the machine itself. 

When discussing the nvidia paper we noted that the output was super-normative... precisely because - it is a difference that makes a difference when it comes aesthetic novelty. The _selection_ of a difference, of novelty as valued and valuable is where machine learning falls short. The machine learning algorithm works weel in gaming because we can stipulate the conditions for a win. As someone put it nicely yesterday in the arts and humanities we dont know how to win  -  that said - we know it when we see it. So while machine's are a powerful means for producing novelty they are hopeless at realising when a particular novelty is interesting. The most interesting thing in both cases was not that an algorithm could 'think better than us' but that it could produce novelty - aesthetic intrigue, new understanding of the game - that it could never 'select' for.





## Frankenmonsters in Education.

So as my bio states I'm apparently here under the guise of Polygon Door...a private creative tech lab I set up with another precarious uninveristy worker to explore the possibilty of forging an academic life outside of and away from the rolling casual 'contracts'of our precarious university existence. Under that guise I've spent the last year or so playing/designing/programming and teaching with programmable drawing machines - robots that draw. We developed the robot, wrote and api, and designed a pedagogy for exploring creativity as a process of experimentation and observation. While the robot appeals - because _robot_ - the power of the device is that it routes around the notion that knowledge production - creative thinking, aesthetic invention - occurs in head. It has been a lot of fun watching students learn to learn the power of an algorithm to realise and extend novelty - and to explore creative thinking and, yes innovation, as based in action and observation. Students (a parents/teachers) think they students are learning 'robotics' but what they actually learn is to think creatively, to learn to learn, by acting and observing and acting again. At some point a local high school took an interest and we 'pivoted' to that opportunity because some advisor told us thats what tech start-ups do (another bas abstraction for another day). Teachers love our little machine because students learn with it but Principals love it cause it ticks the STEM and Digital Curriculum box. The kits sell themsleves but I'm not really interested in selling tech to schools.
We've discovered that in the schools they seem to sit on shelves in 'maker spaces' equipped with mostly unused 3D printers. They robots serve a weird kind of purpose - they service a feral abstraction which cares nothing for their potential value as mechanism of knowledge production. Part of the issue is that technology alone is a bad abstraction for solving problems in learning and teaching (LMS's anyone?) and our problems in learning and teaching are tied to a monsterous machinic hybrid of policy, architecture, infrastructure and affect that has its own feral or perhaps zombie continuity. Technology alone can't refactor the bad abstractions at the heart and continuity of our education system - what is required is a refactoring of the abstractions of what it means to learn - and this would require us to begin again - to experiment with new abstractions. How the hell is that possible in the face of such a monstorous and multifacted continuity - under the demands on teachers to audit students, schools to audit teachers, and so on, and so on. 

The same intervention is required in the realm of academic knowledge prodcution - I'm sure there are one or two academics that will empathise with my robots. The problem is not technical - it's zombie infrastructural, 

## It's the abstraction stupid.

 I also teach media art at UOW.
 One of the things I do there is that  I use aesthetics and code to teach _abstraction_. 

Good programming is all about abstraction. Thats is its core activity. It is not principally about technical skills. Find a good abstraction and a program will write itself - teach a programmer abstraction and they will learn to code themselves. When we teach programming in media arts at UOW or at Polygon Door we immerse students in a study of an aesthetic - Perhaps Manfred Mohr, or Bridget Riley. In doing so we shift the emphasis away from technical skills to the abstraction of an aesthetic. In pursuit of an aesthetic Student's realise and are immersed in its complexity - sometimes they realise that they need to refactor their program because the aesthetic wasn't about circles (for instance) after all - the aesthetic drives the programming the programming immerses the student in an aesthetic. If the program becomes hard to write - its probably a bad abstraction and its time to refactor  - to rewrite the program starting with a different set of assumptions...a different abstraction. This approach successfully shifts the emphasis away from technical skill acquisition and technology more generally. Learning programming as skills acquisition is a technqiue based on a bad abstraction- that programming is about learning a language, about syntax. It also means my students occasionally produce interesting art. Their art is interesting because for the most part it avoids looking like yet another creative coding processing sketch. Creative coding sketches in the wider tend to look kind of similar. Their aesthetic is driven by what Processing's abstractions like to do when they succesfully outsource their affect to humans - produce lots of processing sketches. Same goes for any technical architecture. 90% of sound art sounds like PD/Max. 90% of presentations are a list of points.. until some tech person goes- wait a minute there must be a technical solution to that and then 50% of those 90% and up swirling incohate, motion sickness inducing, presy presentations.

## Livelihood as Abstraction Part 1 - Clean Trails.

One of my Life's obsessions is endurance trail running. My sport was until recently a quaint backwater of amatuerism. No-one was making any money - people actually did it for the running. That has changed, more people entered the sport, a market grew, a social media presence grew and events were streamed, more people entered the sport, athletes got sponsored, events became profitable, events got prize money, athletes have started to eek out a livlihood. All of a sudden drugs are a problem where before the notion of taking drug to complete or compete in a trail run would have been absurd - counter to the reason for doing it. A feral abstraction has taken hold. For a set of elite runners, trail running is now only secondarily about running. Its about livlihood. It seems that running clean and independently is a bad abstraction for livlihood, for genrating a large social media presence. It needed refactoring - so now trail running is an industry - and it is no longer just about the running - this is good for the sport apparently - the professionalism that is... Drugs are always bad - the problem is always the dirty runner... not the bad abstraction that sees performance enhancement as the right abstraction for genrating livlihood. It suddenly dawned on us all.. we got it round the wrong way...running isn't meant to be the abstraction for industry and it turns out that industry is a really shitty abstraction for clean running- but the Brumby has bolted...the feral abstraction is loose.  

## Livliehood as abstraction Part 2 - Knowledge Production.

The workshops framing statement says that 'for years academics have submitted to the poltical economy of the publishig industries' for 'esteem, prestige, job security (?), an outlet for intellectual expression, a basis for research money and some sense of community. The first three of these, esteem, prestige, and job security? are great abstractions of human affect in the service of sustaining a publishing industry. Its the right abstraction for the publishing industry and has trumped the latter two abstractions (community and intellectual expression). The industry has abandoned those last two (intellectual expression and community) because it turns out that providing an outlet for intellectual expression and commmunity are not great abstractions of affect in the service of an industry. 

But wait.... I've got it all round the wrong way... we didn't want an industry... we wanted knowledge production. Commmunity and Intellectual expression weren't meant to be abstractions they were meant to be abstractions for industry -  the publishing industry was meant to be an abstraction for them.
