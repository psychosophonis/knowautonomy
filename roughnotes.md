- Who are you? Why are you here? Fibreculture, UOW - where I use media art, code, and aesthetics to teach _abstraction_, A year and a half ago I founded Polygon Door - and attempt to forge an academic life of material research outside either university or corporation..

- I enjoy hacking ideas, machines, code in order to explore what they might do. 

To that end I'm interested in exploring novel 'abstractions'in knowledge production much more than I am in __academic publishing__ -per se. I want to talk about how for ten years i worked voluntarily in academic publishing in spite of that - I kind of diversion of labour away from an intent to experiment.

- In fact my interest in the fibreculture was intially as a place/group/platform that would support such rethinkings and experimentation ....and it was so I also want to talk about how we _all_ spent the last ten years servicing and contributing to an academic journal in spite of that.

To put it another way..
  
I wonder if while Fibreculture's intent in exploring online publishing, open access and open source  -an attempt to 'occupy the academic journal'- actually ended up _occupying_ fibreculture more generally - and in that case whether or not the journal and the journal article were poor abstractions for intellectual expression and academic community. 

In extension of that perhaps I want to ask whether the notion of 'occupying' anything is just a really terrible poltical abstraction. We shouldn't have occupied the journal...we should have refactored.. experimented with novel abstractions. Maybe there is something interesting to note here regarding what I think Ned refered to yesterday as an _autonomy of politics_ as opposed to a _political autonomy_ and the way we think through the political potential of technology... that bigger question motivates what follows.

- I should also acknowledge that there was another project in which I spent considerable amount of time thinking through and writing about cognition, cognitive ecologies, the relationship between mind and media, and the position of technology with regard to our ecology of thinking/feeling - with the help of Andrew.. - Without restating the whole thing I was and contiue to be fascinated on the one hand by Brian Massumi's positioning of affect as central to cognition - perception as cognition - cognition as largely _autonomic_ as opposed to _autonomous_  and on the other hand Stielger's Technics and Time which begins with _'technics apprehended as the horizon of all possibilty to come and all possibilty of a future.'_ 

- Much of this came out of a concern for how we might best build what Stiegler called 'technologies of mind' and which I like to think as a 'spirited technics'. To put it as simply straightforwardly as possible - I'm interested in how we are always thinking with and through technics/machines. So the interesting question (for me) is  not so much a concern for outscourcing of our cognition to machines - but how are we are always doing so, have always done so - and how might we do it better or differently. 

I think there is a beguiling play between words autonomy and autonomic here.. and so I wonder if an autonomy of poltics might depend on careful attention to the autonomic continuities that begin with an intial abstraction and the way that abstraction modulates our interaction with a particular machine/algorithm.

I'm positing abstraction as a kind of proto technics - forming a horizon of technical possibility...
 
- and as an aside.... after yesterday I madly rewrote my already rewritten dot points become paper - become book chapter- become monograph - and had to search FCJ for a reference .... and I kind of suddenly realised how cool it is - and that I should stop being a critical bastard and just let it be... and thank everybody who contributed because its a terrific archive of interesting work. Its more than enough. But what now. Ned posited some interesting hacks...but I wonder whether rather than gaming the system we might instead formulate a series of experiments with novel abtsractions for intellectual expression and academic community.

----------------

So in dialogue with the workshop's framing statement while I'm not so concerened with the outsourcing of cognition - we have always outsourced cognition it is a function of how we think - I am more worried about the way machines outsource their affect to us - and the way that can result in a kind of feral continuity. The kind of artificial that concerns me is a techno-bureacratic artificiality-  an automation of relations that (amongst other things) disavows care. That might include a lack of care for each other, for the medium itself, for intellectual expression ,but also more generally a culture of futures or futurity.

The most woriesome of 'artificial intelligence' or 'autonomous systems' are perhaps those of the bureaucracy and policy in which feral abstractions have become oddly infrastructural - oddly because they remain visible, we'd like to replace them or update them, but they sustain themselves via their relentless demands for service and debt calling, and in doing suck the energy out of any potential for addressing or redressing the abstraction that provides the basis for their continuity. 

I've seen these feral continuities in university learning and teaching, in our high schools, in the health system (most tragically), and of course in academic systems of knowldge production. The latter is my concern here. 

-----------------

When I started with FCJ I was motivated by the thought that my strange blend of interests in tech and theory  might find an outlet there. The mailing list with which Fibreculture had begun and which had initally been a means of coalescing and organising for a dispersed community of antidisicplinary outsider academics in a nascent field was inspiring but was nearing the end of its 'life' -  Mailing lists were/are actually great vehicles for community and intellectual expression. The good thing about that is that online communities (which are too fragile to be coopted), intellectual expression, and mailing lists apparently don't make great abstractions for anything else (esteem, prestige for example) and so mailing lists thankfully die a natural timely death once they cease to serve as the basis for community or intellectual expression. 

This is a great and misunderstood thing. We should let things die. If we dont let our abstractions live and die on their own terms we infect them with franken-affects and create zombie continuities. This should provide a note for the workshop statement's 'horizon of doom', 'futurity without purpose' for 'the knowledge genrated out of the academy' and fear of the journal article's absolesence -  my advice is to embrace the horizon of doom, embrace purposelessness, celebrate the journal article's obsolescense - hit the beach if thats where you want to be (I'll see you there or run past you), but if your desire is for academic community and intellectual expression then its time to refactor. 

The demand to refactor comes from programming. Its usually the case when writing a program that at some point writng the code becomes laborious - a point at which you start fighting against  the abstraction from which you began and upon which all subsequent code is based. The desire is to keep pushing the abstraction - beniding it to your will - but eventually you come to a point when you understand there was a better way - a better abstraction from which to begin (or there HAD to be) - and to move forward you must refactor - start again with a different abstraction. Note that the problem is rarely the code itself- its not a technical problem and therefore doesn't have a technical solution - its the _idea_ that structures the code- thats shapes your subsequent interaction, or possible interactions with it.

So.. Journals.

The workshops framing statement says that 'for years academics have submitted to the poltical economy of the publishig industries' for 'esteem, prestige, job security (?), an outlet for intellectual expression, a basis for research money and some sense of community. The first three of these, esteem, prestige, and job security? are great abstractions of human affect in the service of sustaining a publishing industry. Its the right abstraction for the publishing industry its works well to sustain it...but its makes a great example of the kind of the artificial- intelligence that concerns me - that techno-bureacratic artificiality-  an automation of relations that (amongst other things) disavows care as I said that might include a lack of care for each other, for the medium itself, for intellectual expression, but also more generally a culture of futures or futurity. In the poltical economy of the publishing industry we saw the the latter two abstractions (community and intellectual expression) dumped because it turns out that providing an outlet for intellectual expression and commmunity are not great abstractions of affect in the service of an industry and institution. 

But we didn't want to work in the sustain of an industry (or institution) did we? - to eek out a 'relevance' within it - as it was positied yeaterday... we wanted knowledge production. Commmunity and Intellectual and expression/writing - and the bodies that produce it -weren't meant to be abstractions in the sustain of an industry -  the publishing industry was meant to be an abstraction for them.  Its time we audited that abstraction...if writing is abstraction for inetllectual expression and community how might we refactor our practices of knowledge production in support of that. Perhaps then we can invert the concern for machines that 'think better than us' - how might we build abstractions that allow us to think better with machines, and build machines that allow us to think better - that is non-autonomously - acknowledging the propensity for our autonomic entrainment according to the potential of a given abstraction - an the potenital it provides for the outsourcing of our affective drive in the service of the machine. How might we build machines/policies/architectures/infrastructures that employ affect in a manner that allows us to exploit what the machine allows *us* to do better - to extend cognition (thinking-feeling) beyond the habitual service of our present abstractions. 

So FCJ...

I took over the journal as the previous manager Lisa Gye couldn't face having to refactor - from manually marking up html to the adoption of a content management system. The great advance of  Web2.0 was apparently the realisation that we should seperate form from content - and indeed the possibilty of coding endless web pages by hand seemed to back that up. In hindsight I wonder if the values of that separation were overegged - something shifted at that point. When form and content were intertwined it meant you had to always consider both together and form could well follow content. You were encouraged back to look at the abstraction again (is this a traditional journal article?) - potentially refactor form specifically for a paper. It allowed you the agility to support novel experiments in knowldge production and manipulate form in its service. After web2.0 content increasingly followed form not the other way round. Of course it was not sustainable to run a journal otherwise... but Fibreculture  was born with this kind of question in mind.. once the form was set The Journal became a container for writing. The Journal abstraction was thus well embedded... automatic..  

I chose WP as architectures and went  because its seperation of form from content was based on a good simple abstraction - the power of that abstraction (site as journal as a series of posts)is the secret to wordpress continued dominance online (26% of the web in 2016). The simplest abstraction is almost always the right abstraction. The more we encode assumptions as elaborate abstractions of process and form the less agile your abstraction is - and the more likely at some point you will be forced to refactor the entire thing - an important note for when we refactor academic writing. Wordpress hasn't required refactoring in 15 years... its remarkable really.

When this involves a manipulation and interwining of code and content (as html did - and which required a massive effort to extract the legacy content) the more likely your are to be caught within that abstraction - your only choice is to serve it because the work invovled in moving it would be vast or the content itself would need refiguring. WP's simple, agile, abstraction would ostensibly allow us to refactor at any point - meaning we aren't (as) subject to the franken-affect platform bias - and we could actively experiment with novel abstractions of fibrecultural content. We can still abstract the whole journal as a json file - in fact you could do it today...because its licensced 'cc-by' anyone can ... (another note to the fear of data expropriation expressed in the framing statement - i don't think you can have your commons and dictate its terms..). The fact is - that we never really did this because we were too busy serving the journal as an abstraction in service and in perpetuation of the poltical economy of academic publishing.

I still think wordpress was a good abtraction for an academic journal. It needed some tweaking and perhaps an adherence to the form of a traditional journal meant I built complexity on top of WP's lovely simple abstraction that made it more difficult for others to work on the mundane technical stuff that needed to be done. The real mistake was that the academic journal was a shitty abstraction for a system of networked knowledge production, for intellectual expression, and community. This is the crux of this diatribe about feral abstraction. 

One of the other things that happened was that increasingly the development of infrastructures around open access publishing shifted from experimenting with novel forms and potentialities of openness - of an intellectual commons - to once of competing with (the corporate publishing industry and with other publications) and for the network effect in pursuing citations (a weird abstraction of reading). Time potentially spent between issues working on novel abstractions of knowledge production afforded by my lovely open source and content management system was spent building plugins to meet the demands of the next best greatest metadata standard, or the metadata standards of open access repositories, or of corporate or institutional indexers. 

If I denied that development citations would be sacrificed, the standing of the journal would slip, and so on and so on. While fundamentally opposed to audit culture we seemd completely indebted to its demands as an 'academic journal'. We were using the network - this agile, indeterminate, open beast to 'occupy' a shitty feral industrial abstraction which had already abstracted away intellectual expression and community (many society journals had long ago given over their intellectual capital to publishing houses) as the means to refactor and explore new abstractions for community and intellectual expression (as the fibreculture mailing list serendipitously did). In occupying that feral abstraction we've been pushing shit up hill trying to reaasert the journal as a useful abstraction for intellectual expression and community.

This leads to platform bias. Increasingly it seemed the Open Journal System (OJS) made all of that network effect management stuff really easy. The demand to move to it was and is still great. Having transitioned one other journal to it - I'd rather stab myself in the eye. OJS further embeds logics and hierarchies of traditional academic journal production deep in its terribly convoluted code base. While the WP abstraction begins with a user, a post, and maybe comments - OJS begins with articles, reviewers, editors, contributors, managing editors, administrators, readers, reviews, volumes etc etc... While OJS is open source, its source is completely lacking in agility or openness, its abraction is deeply embedded. This means that there is realistically and without much hacking around only one form of journal that can be produced with it, one form of journal article. Transitioning to OJS would would free FCJ from the demands of meeting those aformentioned metdata requirements, it would be good for citations. But... we would be thoroughly and further entrained with the 'political economies of the publishing industry' -  we'd have completely *occupied* the academic journal...it'll be great *for* the journal, for its standing, its esteem. It will ensure we have a 'futurity with purpose'....right?

We can't actually  know how any abstraction will play out - we have to play it, abstractions demand material research - but we can 'audit' that abstraction in experimentation and play (indeed we have a responsibility to do so) - check that its doing what we signed it up for and if its time to refactor. The journals is a bad abstraction for the things I wanted it for, those two trade-offs I deemed worthy of our submission to the abstractions of the 'political economy of the publishing industries' - as an 'outlet for intellectual expression' and 'a sense of community'. We'd already decided that the 'poltical economy of the publishing industries' has abstracted away these things and we attempted to occupy the journal as a result. _Occupying_ ended up in an inversion of its intent -we should have seen this coming - occupations rarely serve revolutions. 

So where might that refactoring begin? It seems to me that refactoring might go back to consider why we write - what is the _purpose_ of our intellectual expression, why do we need an _outlet_, why in writing do we need some sense of _community_ - what function does it serve?. Once of the dissapointing aspects of the Journal abstraction is the reality that a journal actually does seem to be the place academic thinking goes to die- Or at least it goes into deep hibernation waiting for a someone searching an index somehwere to temporarily revive in a moment of barely qualified extraction in the form of a citation. As far as I can see (and I watch the analytics in spite of myself) we are writing more and more, and reading less and less. How might we refactor writing in the service of encouraging reading and how might we allow reading to fold forward in continuity with writing so that the network becomes a space of agile multilogue - but wait - it already is that - the technology is there and is not the answer anyway , the answer is perhaps in supporting an ecology of experimentation in open 'minor' abstractions (to call on D&G's notion of the minor) perhaps this is a means to what Ned called a autonomy of politics.

So to conclude..

I want to return to a disucusssion we had yesterday base on Liam's account of those three instances of machine learning. We were speaking about the anxiety produced of the way machine learning seemed to be able to 'think better' than we can - to beat us at our own games. But at the same time we discussed the notion that the alien game play of the machine seemed to divulge something novel about the game itself - new ways of playing - new potential for aesthetic intrigue in the play of the machine itself. This was the most interesting thing about these examples - the production of a weird uncanny morphing of heavily touched up faces, the realisation of a new aesthetic intrigue in the alien play of the machine, the realisation of ways and means of playing beyond our existing and dominant habits and processes - all of which  exist neither within the machine, nor within the body but in their relation - there is a thinking with the machine here that can't be done without either the machines potential for an autonomy of sorts or the human bodies potenital for realising a difference that makes a difference. So while machine's are a powerful means for producing novelty they are hopeless at realising when a particular novelty is interesting. The most interesting thing in both cases was not that an algorithm could 'think better than us' but that it could produce novelty - aesthetic intrigue, new understanding of the game - that it could never 'select' for and we couldn't have imagined...we needed the autonomy of the machine to afford the realisation of a novel aesthetic or conceptual intrigue between body and world. Perhaps this is an interesting place to look for novel abstractions... to hack the archive...but can i do it from the beach??
