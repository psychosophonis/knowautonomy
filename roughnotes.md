The framing statement for this workshop stated that 'the prospect of cognition outsourced to machines is a worry to many'. So I'll start with that - It doesn't worry me in the slightest. Maybe that reflects my status as a precarious knowledge worker and relentless hacker of things and ideas - perhaps I'm less indebted to the knowledge machine, because I couldn't be arsed serving it, dedicating my life to it, I'd rather be running trails or indeed as the framing statement also suggested 'kicking back at another glorious day at the beach'. In previous years it wouldn't have worried me because I'm an experimentalist and technologist...and that was my interest in fibreculture .. surely there was potential for a revolution in knowledge production here right? But I'm done with that...Tech is a bad place to begin - that would be the wrong abstraction built on other wrong abstractions..it tooks me too long to work that out.

So...That said.

The most frightening instances of 'artificial intelligence' or 'autonomous systems' for me are those of the bureaucracy and policy, feral abstractions that have become infrastructural in a weird sense of the term - rather than persisting by becoming invisible and universal in adoption they sustain themselves via their relentless demands for service and debt calling, and in doing suck the energy out of any potential for addressing or redressing the abstraction that provides the basis for their continuity. These are almost always frankenstein monsters - hybrids - where machinic affect is outsourced to humans.. a much bigger problem in my mind than cognition outsourced to machines/policy/technology thought in a bigger Stieglerian sense. 

I've recently seen these frankenmonsters in education - and it makes for a good diagram of the problem - having developed a robot - a programmable drawing machine (a take on the turtlebot using open source electronics - for schools in which kids are able to work with open technology at an aesthetic and exploratory level rather than within STEM's instrumentalist paradigms. It works powerfully - as kids realise aesthetic potential they are motivated to devulge and extend algorithms and solve mechanical, electrical and electronic problems. Teachers love it. Admin loves it cause it seems to fit the STEM drive - but teachers simple have neither the time to use it - it doesn't fit the curriculum, the shape of the classrooms, the teachers disciplinary training and reposnsibilties, as developers we are forced to alter its teaching program to meet curriculum prescribed outcomes and infrastructural demands like 40 minutes classes. Schools love to buy robots because it makes them feel like they bought into the future. But robots sit on shelves in 'maker spaces' equppied with mostly unused 3D printers. Part of the issue is that technology alone is a bad abstraction for solving problems in learning and teaching (LMS's anyone?) and our problems in learning and teaching are tied to a monsterous machinic hybrid of policy, architecture, infrastructure and affect that has its own feral continuity. Teachers know the system is not working so they buy tech to solve it. Technology (and its corporate producers) have successfully outsourced their affect to humans to enable the production of lots more technology. Technology alone can't refactor the bad abstractions at the heart and continuity of our education system. 

Programming is about abstraction. Thats is its core activity. Its principally about technical skills. Find a good abstraction and a program will write itself - teach a programmer abstraction and they will learn to code themselves. When we teach programming in media arts at UOW or at Polygon Door we immerse students in a study of an aesthetic - Perhaps Manfred Mohr, or Bridget Riley. In doing so we shift the emphasis away from technical skills to the abstraction of an aesthetic. In pursuit of an aesthetic they realise and are immersed in its complexity - sometimes they realise that they need to refactor their program because the aesthetic wasn't about circles (for instance) after all - the aesthetic drives the programming the programming immerses the student in an aesthetic. If the program becomes hard to write - its probably a bad abstraction and its time to refactor  - to rewrite the program starting with a different set of assumptions...a different abstraction. This approach successfully shifts the emphasis away from skill acquisition. Starting programming with skills acquisition is a technqiue based on a bad abstraction- that programming is about learning a language, about syntax. It also means my students occasionally produce interesting art. Their art is interesting because for the most part it avoids looking like yet another creative coding processing sketch. Creative coding sketches in the wider world all look kind of similar because their aesthetic is driven by what Processing's abstractions like to do when they succesfully outsource their affect to humans - produce lots of processing sketches. Same goes for any technical architecture. 90% of sound art sounds like PD/Max. 90% of presentations are a list of points.. until some tech guy goes- wait a minute there must be a technical solution to that and then 50% of those 90% and up swirling incohate motion sickness inducing presy presentations.

One of my lifes obsessions is endurance trail running. My sport was until recently a quaint backwater of amatuerism. Noone was making any money - people actually did it for the running. That has changed, more people entered the sport, a market grew, a social media presence grew, more people entered the sport, athletes got sponsored, events became profitable, events got prize money, athletes have started to eek out a livlihood. All of a sudden drugs are a problem where before the notion of taking drug to complete or compete in a trail run would have been absurd - counter to the reason for doing it. A feral abstraction has taken hold. For the elite trail running is now only secondarily about running. Its about livlihood. It seems that running clean and independently is a bad abstraction for livlihood, for genrating a large social media presence. It needed refactoring - so now trail running is an industry - and its no longer just about the running - which is good for the sport.. apparently. It suusdnely dawned on us all.. we got it round the wrong way...running isn't meant to be the abstraction for industry and it turns out that industry is a really shitty abstraction for clean running- but the Brumby has bolted...the feral abstraction is loose.  

The workshops framing statement says that 'for years academics have submitted to the poltical economy of the publishig industries' for 'esteem, prestige, job security (?), an outlet for intellectual expression (? what a novel idea), a basis for research money and some sense of community. The first three of these are great abstractions of human affect in the service of sustaining a publishing industry. The publishing industry has succesfully outsourced its affect in the service of sustaining itself. Its the right abstraction for the publishing industry and has trumped the latter two abstractions (community and intellectual expression). The industry has abandoned those two because it turns out that like running, providing an outlet for intellectual expression and commmunity are not great abstractions of affect in the service of an industry. But wait.... I've got it all round the wrong way... we didn't want an industry... we wanted knowledge production. Commmunity and Intellectual expression weren't meant to be abstractions they were meant to be abstractions for industry -  the publishing industry was meant to be an abstraction for them. 

When I started with FCJ I was motivated by the thought that my tech skills and my theoretical bent might find an outlet there. 
The mailing list with which Fibreculture had begun and which had initally been a means of coalescing and organising for a dispersed community of antidisicplinary outsider academics in a nascent field was inspiring but was nearing the end of its 'life' - the abstractions that make mailing lists such great vehicles for community and intellectual expression also make those communities and expressions burn bright and with many notable exceptions... short (where they are long lived its because the still support one or both - think nettime or empyre). The good thing about that is that online communities (which are too fragile to be coopted), intellectual expression, and mailing lists apparently don't make great abstractions for anything else (esteem, prestige for example) and so mailing lists thankfully die a natural timely death once they cease to serve as the basis for community or intellectual expression. This is a great and misunderstood thing. We should let things die. If we dont let our abstractions live and die on their own terms we infect them with franken-affects and create zombie continuities. This should provide a note for the workshop statement's 'horizon of doom', 'futurity without purpose' for 'the knowledge genrated out of the academy' and fear of the journal article's absolesence -  my advice is to embrace the horizon of doom, embrace purposelessness, celebrate the journal article's obsolescense - hit the beach if thats where you want to be (I'll see you there or run past you), but if your desire is for academic community and intellectual expression then its time to refactor. In  programming the demand to refactor feels kind of positive...you've learnt something fundamental so starting again is actually never starting from the beginning... for me its a eureka moment of sorts - or at least ... 'oh ... now I get it'.

So.. Journals. I took over the journal as the previous manager faced having to refactor - from manually marking up html to the adoption of a content management system.  I think - the lack of seperation of form from content is not as bad as it its web2.0 detractors might have had it. It meant that you didn't embed an assumption of what seperated form from content in your particular expression. Fibreculture (with a number of others at the time) was in part born with this kind of question in mind (Some embraced flash to this end...rendered, proprietary, not open... bad abstraction and those experiemnts are mostly gone or going - Lisa and Andrew made a wise decision here). The problem with not seperating form from content is that you have to deal with both and their interaction (the appropriate abstraction) _all the time_ which is terrific if you have many people for that.

I had experience with Drupal, Wordpress and OJS was just released. All were candidates. I went with WP because its seperation of form from content was based on a good simple abstraction - the power of that abstraction (site as journal as a series of posts)is the secret to wordpress continued dominance (in my opinion)- another aside - good (vital) abstractions are nearly always simple (or the simplest possible for the application - this is drupal's problem). This seperation of form form content meant we would need to go through the torture of extracting form from content when the next best system came along. It would allow us to refactor at any point - meaning we aren't (as) subject to the franken-affect platform bias - and we could actively experiment with novel abstractions of fibrecultural content. We can still abstract the whole journal as a json file - in fact you could do it today...because its licensced 'cc-by' anyone can ... (another note to the fear of data expropriation expressed in the framing statement - i don't think you can have your commons and dictate its terms..). 

This was a good start. I still think wordpress was a good abtraction for an academic journal. It needed some tweaking and perhaps an adherence to the form of a traditional journal meant I built complexity into the form that made it more difficult for others to work on the mundane technical stuff that needed to be done. The real mistake was that the academic journal was a shitty abstraction for a system of networked knowledge production, for intellectual expression, and community. This is the crux of this diatribe about feral abstraction. 

For the past 3 years or so FCJ has felt like a beast that required serving and part of a machine that required endless servicing. I have feared impending issues reaching editorial completion just as I knew my fellow managing editors had feared the issues' delivery - and quite rightly - the work was enormous and increasing as the demands to publish meant writing had become secondary to publishing, publishing had become secondary to instituional and professional audit, moreover community had been suffocated out, reading had been abstracted out completely (because you can't measure it) so finding reviewers who would deliver was tough. We increasingly felt like the journal had become 'a publishing service' for time poor academics. Moreover sometimes it felt that as independent community publication we were for many a second or third option - this seemed more true following the arbitrary journal rankings circus took hold - a better example of the inanity of audit culture I am yet to see (dumber than naplan). Of course many who succesfully published with us did so in dedication to the project itself- for these people the journal remained or was worth fighting for as an outlet of intellectual expression and/or community. The editorial and managerial weight of producing the journal however meant that it struggled to serve these people well in the face of other demands. Moreover we were working completely voluntarily and indpendently without institutional support. Which is fine if the journal is serving your (meaning my) needs as well - for me this meant the potential for playing with new forms of knowledge production and intellectual expression _as_ intellectual expression and the basis for community. Of course it provided other things ... esteem and the minor pirvelidge of remaining engaged with academia depsite and in service of my precarious employment. 




reading had become secondary to writing, purposelessness

We were using the network - this agile, indeterminate, open beast to 'occupy' a shitty feral industrial abstraction which had already abstracted away intellectual expression and community (many society journals had long ago given over their intellectual capital to publishing houses) as the means to refactor and explore new abstractions for community and intellectual expression (as the fibreculture mailing list serendipitously did). In occupying that feral abstraction we've been pushing shit up hill trying to reaasert the journal as a useful abstraction for intellectual expression and community. 




Tech as the wrong abstraction for journal problems.
open access as the wrong abstraction for acadmeic freedom.
occupy as the wrong abstraction for revolution. 























... These are the continuities you'd like to tear down but end up servicing in the mean time and which in their demand for service take away the time required for us to 'refactor' - to explore the potenital new abstractions from which to begin.

In my 

We are surrounded by examples (education, health, capital as the meta-feral continuity etc etc). Today however I want to think about the Journal as a bundle of abstractions that

We are enslaved and serve their continuity because we are indebted to them in some way. Capital is the meta-feral of course but we are surrounded by bad abstractions, the ecology of academic journal publishing is another, but a metric, a standard, a software abstraction or technological abstraction, might also decribe/afford different and/or intertwined kinds of feral (or perhaps zombie) continuity. 

Increasingly publishing The Fibreculture Journal has felt like this depsite its achievements and succeses. It feels Like we are caught up in the continuity of a bad abstraction - or a matrix of bad abstractions. 



Because we are enslaved/indebted to these assemblages taking a degree of autonomy back by occupying them seems like a good political manouvre. 

The Fibreculture Journal was in some sense founded with that notion and opportunity in mind. 

The opportunities presented by the maturing internet would allow an independence from the dictates and limits of a corporatised academic publishing ecology and would also support the work of an academic community that was fiercely interdisciplinary and which fancied itself as a little bit feral in another sense of the term - grazing in the university quadrangles while dreaming of digital revolutions (how quaintly optimistic revolutions sounds in the age of disruption!). 

Fibreculture was initially a mailing list inspired and descended from nettime (Geert Lovink being the common party) and so it is perhaps interesting to think through the dynamics of this departure.

The journal was founded with Lisa Gye and Andrew Murphie at the helm in part as a means of consolidating and documenting the energy of the meetings and collaborations that the list supported (in terms of knowledge production and organisations) and gave rise to at its height and in part as an extension of fibreculture's political project; The internet would allow the community to effectively 'occupy' academic publishing - the content would be as (or more) rigourous than the corporate academic publishers, double-blind peer reviewed, open access (before it was a 'movement'), and visible, open to the network (published in html - open standards as well as access). It would be a new type of journal fit for a new culture of networked knowledged production. 

The Fibreculture Journal did achieve both of those ends. It consolidated and gave the work begun on the list a continuity that far surpassed its fast,bright, burn and gave a forum to long-form theory and research in a manner that helped define and sustain a particular vector of new and network media and cultural theory. The journal remains completely independent. Indeed -up until recently the journal existed without any formalised legal structure, direct instutional support, or even an address beyond its url while continuing to publish some of the most influential and progressive writers and thinkers in a unique vector of academic inquiry that it continues to define. 

That said we've increasingly found ourselves (those who keep the journal ticking over) 


















Now this is where I want to sound a warning - all vital abstractions are to some degree 'feral' - that is we are always subject-to one abstraction or another and we should avoid taking the well worn paths of revolutionaries before us to suggest that _our_ abstraction is somehow going to provide us more or less autonomy that  


I will  place the artificial as a techno-bureacratic artificiality, an automation of relations that (amongst other things) disavows care. That might include a lack of care for each other, for the medium itself, but also more generally a culture of (the) future(s).The promise of online publishing becomes the nightmare of mundane, bureaucratic, and largely automated systems of knowledge management that as much as possible abstract away any actual interaction between knowledge producers (mostly in the interests of quantifying and accounting for knowledge production). To put it bluntly, there is not much collegiality left in the ecology of publishing (as a precarious knowledge worker, I am not sure if it is still there in the university). What is the role of technology in the production of these feral abstractions? 

At its heart programming is about abstraction. Find the 'good' abstraction and the program tends to write itself - which I suppose is an extension of finding a good metaphor when writing. A 'good' abstraction is however in very rare occasions the 'right' abstraction - Where the right abstraction is one that demonstrates and elucidates the intention with which the programmer proposed it.  A weed has arguably evolved as great abstraction of wide ranging environmental conditions. A weed is rarely the 'right' abstraction for the environment onto which it grafts. A (good) programmer is continuously 'refactoring' - a term which I think is unique to programming and which refers to the realisation that at some point the abstraction upon which your program is built is fundamentally limiting or distracting and that the only way forward is to rewrite the program from scratch. Refactoring is never a failure - it is a realisation made via an immersion in the mechanics of the abstraction and its interaction with the language upon which it builds. Of course you need to be immersed in these mechanics in order to realise the need to refactor or how to go about it - otherwise you are left to critique as subject-to the abstraction (and critique is subject of it own its mediums abstractions as well). 

Having finally exhausted any remnant of techno-optimism I am reluctant to propose that what we need are new abstractions, to refactor academic knowledge production - to move well away from the demands to account, quantify and measure based on the exisiting ones and to refactor modes of 'academic' writing and communicating (of course 'academic' might well be the wrong abstraction).
