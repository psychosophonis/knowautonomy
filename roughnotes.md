The most frightening instances of 'artificial intelligence' or 'autonomous systems' for me are those of the bureaucracy and policy, feral abstractions that have become infrastructural in a weird sense of the term - in that they suck the energy out of any potential for addressing or redressing the abstraction that provides the basis for their continuity. 

These are infrastructures that contrary to the usual definition, retain their visibilty because they embody a feral dissonance. Perhaps we are enslaved and serve their continuity because we are indebted to them in some way. Capital is the meta-feral of course, the ecology of academic journal publishing is another, but a metric, a standard, a software abstraction or technological abstraction, might also decribe/afford different and/or intertwined kinds of feral (or perhaps zombie) continuity. 

Because we are enslaved/indebted to these assemblages taking a degree of autonomy back by occupying them seems like a good political manouvre. 

The Fibreculture Journal was in some sense founded with that notion and opportunity in mind. The opportunities presented by the maturing internet would allow an independence from the dictates and limits of a corporatised academic publishing ecology and would also support the work of an academic community that was fiercely interdisciplinary and which fancied itself as a little bit feral in another sense of the term - grazing in the university quadrangles while dreaming of digital revolutions (how quaintly optimistic revolutions sounds in the age of disruption!). 

Fibreculture was initially a mailing list inspired and descended from nettime (Geert Lovink being the common party) and so it is perhaps interesting to think through the dynamics of this departure. The fibreculture list was thought as a means of political organisation - an organised network - enabling a continuity of extra-institutional meetings and collaborations - but it was (like nettime) also a place of spirited autonomous discussion. - with that autonomy came a degree of noise, and at some point the noise exhausted the list as a kind of vital continuity.

The journal was founded with Lisa Gye and Andrew Murphie at the helm in part as a means of consolidating and documenting the energy of the meetings and collaborations that the list supported (in terms of knowledge production and organisations) and gave rise to at its height and in part as an extension of fibreculture's political project; The internet would allow the community to effectively 'occupy' the academic journal - the content would be as (or more) rigourous than the corporate academic publishers, double-blind peer reviewed, open access (before it was a 'movement'), and visible, open to the network (published in html - open standards as well as access). It would be a new type of journal fit for a new culture of networked knowledged production. 

The Fibreculture Journal did achieve both of those ends. It consolidated and gave the work begun on the list a continuity that far surpassed its fast,bright, burn and gave a forum to long-form theory and reserach in a manner that helped define and sustains a particular vector of new and network media and cultural theory. The journal remains completely independent. Indeed -up until recently the journal existed without any formalised legal structure, direct instutional support, or even an address beyond its url while continuing to publish some of the most influential and progressive writers and thinkers in a unique vector of academic inquiry that it continues to define. 


















Now this is where I want to sound a warning - all vital abstractions are to some degree 'feral' - that is we are always subject-to one abstraction or another and we should avoid taking the well worn paths of revolutionaries before us to suggest that _our_ abstraction is somehow going to provide us more or less autonomy that  


I will  place the artificial as a techno-bureacratic artificiality, an automation of relations that (amongst other things) disavows care. That might include a lack of care for each other, for the medium itself, but also more generally a culture of (the) future(s).The promise of online publishing becomes the nightmare of mundane, bureaucratic, and largely automated systems of knowledge management that as much as possible abstract away any actual interaction between knowledge producers (mostly in the interests of quantifying and accounting for knowledge production). To put it bluntly, there is not much collegiality left in the ecology of publishing (as a precarious knowledge worker, I am not sure if it is still there in the university). What is the role of technology in the production of these feral abstractions? 

At its heart programming is about abstraction. Find the 'good' abstraction and the program tends to write itself - which I suppose is an extension of finding a good metaphor when writing. A 'good' abstraction is however in very rare occasions the 'right' abstraction - Where the right abstraction is one that demonstrates and elucidates the intention with which the programmer proposed it.  A weed has arguably evolved as great abstraction of wide ranging environmental conditions. A weed is rarely the 'right' abstraction for the environment onto which it grafts. A (good) programmer is continuously 'refactoring' - a term which I think is unique to programming and which refers to the realisation that at some point the abstraction upon which your program is built is fundamentally limiting or distracting and that the only way forward is to rewrite the program from scratch. Refactoring is never a failure - it is a realisation made via an immersion in the mechanics of the abstraction and its interaction with the language upon which it builds. Of course you need to be immersed in these mechanics in order to realise the need to refactor or how to go about it - otherwise you are left to critique as subject-to the abstraction (and critique is subject of it own its mediums abstractions as well). 

Having finally exhausted any remnant of techno-optimism I am reluctant to propose that what we need are new abstractions, to refactor academic knowledge production - to move well away from the demands to account, quantify and measure based on the exisiting ones and to refactor modes of 'academic' writing and communicating (of course 'academic' might well be the wrong abstraction).
