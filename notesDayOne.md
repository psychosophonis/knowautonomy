## Introduction

Open Access....Openness.. and automaticity.

Hardt and Negri..... Autonomy of Politics.
Refusing the techniques of enclosure... autonomous publishing ... aaaaaaarrrgh... monoskop.


Secret Societies.

Marcel Mars.... Public Library.
Economy of piracy..
Capitlism encourages dissent....test novel abstractions...wait for the IPO.

Autonomy of Politics rather than Politcal Autonomy. (Needs minor abstractions).

Other framing idea... Artificial Intelligence...Rise of robot labour etc etc... Academic fear of purposelessness..
Supply chain capitalism... I really dont care who effectively exercises me.....

Below the threshold of perception.. Accepting Cookies.....
Worried primarily about platform capitalism....

Regulation and policy...
FANG companies..but what of the long tail of automation. 

The idea of the state?! Not at all withering....??? State is entirely multifaceted. Unfit to regulate...
Prevalence of data analytics... insurance liability etc. Gining in to the feral abstraction of automated ease..

Autonomy, automation and power.... a new project...
Autonomous Media. Advancement of Illegal Knowledge....The Media Archive.. Introduce the idea of sovereign media.
Contest of sovereign power and the state did not have a monopoloy on it...the rise of platform capitalism before it was named..
The power extended by media... Harold Innes, Kittler.  Thress scholls of medium thoery... habermas,kittler, Nick ...
Media as a technological form that transforms power.. agency and feminims.. contest of the semiosphere.. 
substantive forces that have world making capability (what is world making capability? - facebook, china is not the factory of the world).
Blockchain as world making? Sovereign Media -> autononous media??? sense of political autonomy /autonomy of politics... activist politics?

An end to voluntary labour..?? isn't that an end to amateurism..... hmmm.... mining OA journals...remix capacity....generating papers..
Paper generator...
DeepL.

Liam....

3 Papers.... 

Translate as a boon for OA?? But wtf is OA. Feral abstrcactions..

Semi-autonomous systems.. its the 'semi' that worries me.
making an impact via the title of a paper. tenure seeking - uses off the shelf software..fed in images from data site..
train the system. designed to provoke  response... but ...


Research as quasi-autonomous.....bad abstraction at work.
The need to reply...seems to show a dgree of moderation to the autonomous potenital of the paper.

AlphaGo Zero: learning form Scratch.

Games embed an outcome and so are particularly ripe for machine learning. 
Would be interesting to read the two papers togther.. Setting goals....

Third paper.. 

Reserach produced by corporate autonomy.
GANS - Generative Adverserial Network. 

GAN as peer review....One autonomous agent reviews another. Unsupervised learning

The extent to which there is an automatic production of aesthetic effect. 

The important question is how we think with the machine...
aesthetic intrigue...new aesthetics??!? powerpoint and mondrian..a design aesthetic level.


its still about abstraction....


## Open Knowledge and Publishing.

Chinese Publishing Systems.

Platforms, 'BAT' and Chinese Digital Publishing.
Dr Xiang Ren - Australia-China Institute for Arts and Culture.

Chinese worry about BAT not GAVA/FANG

Born Digital is the fast growing.

300 million people read digital only.
90%, 16-45%.

Platformisation of Digital Publishing

- Infrastructural Intermediaries
- 'Network Effects' and competing platforms.
- Big Data and Algorithms mathching contetn and readers.
-Thin Marginal Profit

Features of Digital Publishing Platforms.

Platfomr Lock-In
Super IP - an interesting shift in China's digital creative economy.
Super IP Frenzy.
The impossibilty of innovation outside of the constraints/abstractions.

- 'Content start-up' - make readers happy.
- Digital publishing is a data industry.

Open Knowledge vs. Digital Capitalism.


## Lucy Montgomery

Big Data, Collective Action & OA Books.

- More Collective Action??
- Knowledge Unlatched.
- Monographs 
- Lack of a connection....reading is the wrong abstraction - writing as part of the research process.
- Bad abstractions....Rtuen on investment for our writing.
- Sale of Monographs are Dropping.
- Not about money?! Specialist..

A (suprisingly) Fragmented Market.

The opposite of FCJ. An emrgent Amateurism allows refactoring of the abstraction.
